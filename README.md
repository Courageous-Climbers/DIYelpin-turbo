## Overview
DIYelpin-TURBO is a site where people can share their DIY projects with others.  Users view all posts submitted and can up-vote projects that they like.  There is a contest page where users can submit entries for a food contest that creates 5 random ingredients each day.

## Features

### View DIY-Posts
The main login page is a tiled list view of DIY projects that have been submitted.  Each post can be up-voted and there are filters to help users to search based on text and category.  The items on the page are also sortable by votes and date.

Below is a preview of the main page.

### Create a DIY-Post
Once logged in, users may create a post about any Do-It-Yourself project they would like to share.  The instructions for the project are Markdown formatted. A preview window shows how the markdown formatted text will be displayed (as shown below).

### Food Contest
If a user navigates to contest, users can participate in a food challenge involving 5 random ingredients for that day.  There is a drop down in the top left corner, so that past contests can be viewed.
